<div id="about-my-work" class="section level1">
<h1>About my work</h1>
<p>My name is Monica Gerber and I am a Biostatistician located in Boston, Massachusetts. I have worked at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) since January 2015, when I joined the Department of Psychiatry to work in a research group focused on population mental health. Currently, I work in <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/children/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1577">General Academic Pediatrics</a> and the <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/cchi/">Center for Community Health Improvement</a> (CCHI).</p>
<p>At MGH I have the pleasure of working on many research and evaluation projects. In General Academic Pediatrics, I work for Dr. Taveras on several maternal and childhood obesity research studies. At CCHI, I help the evaluation team develop statistical analyses to understand the public health status of Boston’s communities and to evaluate prevention efforts. I am also the Principal Investigator of the Health Starts at Home implementation study which provides services to stabilize housing.</p>

<h1>Why this blog?</h1>
<p>I learned how to use SAS in graduate school when I was earning my M.P.H. at Boston University School of Public Health. I later started to learn R and SQL on the job. I find programming in R to be a joy and I hope to explore everything related to R and public health on this blog.</p>
