<div id="about-my-work" class="section level1">
<h1>About my work</h1>
<p>My name is Monica Gerber and I am a Biostatistician located in Boston, Massachusetts. I have worked at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) since January 2015, when I joined the Department of Psychiatry to work in a research group focused on population mental health. Currently, I work in <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/children/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1577">General Academic Pediatrics</a> and the <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/cchi/">Center for Community Health Improvement</a> (CCHI).</p>
<p>At MGH I have the pleasure of working on many research and evaluation projects. In General Academic Pediatrics I work on <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/children/research/general-academic-pediatrics-ongoing-projects.aspx">several</a> maternal and childhood obesity research studies. At CCHI, I help the evaluation team develop statistical analyses to understand the public health status of Bostonâ€™s communities and to evaluate prevention efforts. I am also the Principal Investigator of the Health Starts at Home implementation study which provides services to stabilize housing.</p>

<h1>Why this blog?</h1>
<p>When I learned how to use SAS in graduate school, there was a community of fellow biostatistics and epidemiology students all struggling through the same problems and sharing ideas. One thing about R that inspires me is the amazing and supportive online community. I hope that through this blog I will be able to connect with other public health data science folks. Please reach out or comment on a post!</p>
