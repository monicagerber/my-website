One analysis in the R community that caught my attention is Hilary Parker's analysis of [the most poisoned baby name in US history](https://hilaryparker.com/2013/01/30/hilary-the-most-poisoned-baby-name-in-us-history/). I was surprised that my own name didn't show up in the analysis. If Hilary had a huge loss in 1993, what happened to Monica in 1999? 

For a period when I was a kid the name 'Monica' is what made the adults turn down the NPR broadcast. Its entrance into popular culture due to the [Clinton Impeachment](https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/935600676184477696), a shoutout in [Mambo No. 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK_LN3XEcnw), and also being name of the the least likable roommate on Friends (#bossy), wasn't exactly the kind of material that was going to make me cool. 

But now I am fond of my name again and I'm also looking back on that cultural moment with a new lens thanks to Monica Lewinsky's awesome [talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame).

However, with the `babynames` package on CRAN, taking a look into how poisoned 'Monica' was in the 90s was simple.

# &#127897; One, two, three, four, five &#127897;

## The `babynames` package

Since Hilary conducted her analysis, it's much easier to get the baby names data because it is now available as a package on CRAN. The data frame includes the year, sex, name, and frequency of the name. It also includes the proportion, `prop`, of people of that gender and name born in that year. 

```{r data, message=FALSE}
library(babynames)
head(babynames)
str(babynames)
```

In Hilary's analysis she looked at the top 1000 names in a given year, so I will follow that methodology. 

One other difference is that we can now calculate the relative risk using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

## Data wrangling

First I will limit the data set to the top 1000 names in a year and then calculate the relative risk. 

```{r relrisk, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

top1000 <- babynames %>%
  group_by(sex, year) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number()) %>%
  filter(rank <= 1000) %>%
  group_by(sex, name) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(relrisk = prop/lag(prop)) 
```

The only problem with doing it like this is that if there are gaps that the name made it in the top 1000, the calculation is off. For example, look at the name Aarush. Aarush was in the top 1000 in 2010, then dipped below the top 1000 in 2011 to 2014, and then back in the top 1000 in 2015.

```{r}
library(knitr)

top1000 %>%
  filter(name == "Aarush") %>%
  kable()
```

Ok, let's try this again.

```{r}
top1000 <- babynames %>%
  group_by(sex, year) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number()) %>%
  filter(rank <= 1000) %>%
  group_by(sex, name) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(relrisk = ifelse(year == lag(year)+1, prop/lag(prop), NA),
         loss_pct = (1-relrisk)*100) %>%
  ungroup()
```

It works!

```{r}
top1000 %>%
  group_by(sex, name) %>%
  filter(year != lag(year)+1) %>%
  arrange(name, year, sex)
```

## Biggest percent drops

OK, let's see who has the biggest drops! Did I reproduce the list?

```{r}
top1000 %>%
  arrange(desc(loss_pct)) %>%
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 14) %>%
  select(name, loss_pct, year, n) %>%
  kable()
```

These rankings are *slightly* different than Hilary's but pretty darn close! I think the difference comes from the fact that I didn't round the loss percent. Close enough! 

# &#127930; Jump up and down and move it all around &#127930;

So where does **Monica** stand? Let's take a look at its loss percent compared to the other names.

```{r}
top1000 %>%
  filter(name == "Monica") %>%
  select(name, year, loss_pct, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(loss_pct)) 
```

Only a 34% loss for Monica in 1999 compared to 70% for Hilary in 1993 and 78% for Farrah in 1978.

Let's take a look at the names side by side using ggplot2.

```{r}
top1000 %>%
  mutate(percent = prop*100) %>%
  filter(name == "Monica" | name == "Hilary" | name == "Hillary") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, percent, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Percent of girls given the name Hilary/Hillary or Monica over time",
       y = "Percent",
       x = "Year")
```

Wow, that really changes my perspective. Hilary may have the largest loss percent, but in absolute terms was the drop in Monicas larger? It's hard to tell. It looks like there was already a downward trend after the 1970s, but that the trend started to level off in the 1990s (maybe Monica from Friends wasn't so unpopular after all?!), before plummeting in '98 and '99. 

# &#127925; And if it looks like this then you're doing it right &#127925;

In public health we use both the relative risk[^1] and the risk difference. The usefulness of these measures is often the source of a lot of confusion in the media when there are stories about the benefit of certain treatments and screenings, for example, the benefits of [mammography](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/upshot/how-to-measure-a-medical-treatments-potential-for-harm.html) or the harms of [alcohol use](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/upshot/health-alcohol-cancer-research.html) and [birth control](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/upshot/birth-control-breast-cancer-risks.html). Side note: one reason I love [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) is because they do an excellent job of explaining this to a non-epidemiologist audience. 

The *risk difference (RD)*[^2] is the difference in proportions--it is the absolute effect of a risk factor, or the *excess risk* of disease among those who have been exposed to a vector vs. those who have not been exposed. In the study on alcohol use and breast cancer, a 40-year-old woman has an absolute risk of 1.45 of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years. If she is a light drinker, this risk becomes 1.51 percent. The risk ratio is 1.51/1.45 = `r 1.51/1.45`, or a 4% increase in risk. However, the risk difference is 1.51-1.45 = `r 1.51-1.45`, or an excess risk of .06 per 100. That's 1.2 people for every 2,000 light drinkers. When you put it in absolute terms, the RD brings a different perspective to certain types of risk.

Would the risk difference provide a new perspective to these poisoned names? Let's calculate the risk differences in our babynames data set.

```{r}
rds <- top1000 %>%
  group_by(sex, name) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(riskdiff= ifelse(year == lag(year)+1, prop - lag(prop), NA),
         excessrisk_per10000 = round(riskdiff*10000,1)) %>%
  ungroup()

rds %>%
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  arrange(riskdiff) %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 14) %>%
  select(year, name, n, relrisk, loss_pct, riskdiff, excessrisk_per10000) %>%
  kable()
  
```

So in absolute terms, the biggest drops were among names that have higher frequencies. There is a decrease of 83 Shirley's per 10,000 babies born in the year 1937 compared to the prior year. Sorry Shirley!

Hilary/Hillary and Monica are nowhere near the top losses if we look at the risk difference. 

But what if we compare Hilary to Monica? Who has the biggest drop in absolute terms? 

```{r}
rds %>%
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  filter(name == "Monica" | name == "Hilary" | name == "Hillary",
         year > 1990) %>%
  arrange(riskdiff) %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 10) %>%
  select(year, name, n, riskdiff, excessrisk_per10000) %>%
  kable()
```

Hilary/Hillary still wins!

P.S. Seriously, watch this [talk]((https://www.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame)) by Monica Lewinsky. It's inspiring and says a lot about internet culture today.

[^1]: The relative risk is also referred to as the risk ratio or the cumulative incidence ratio in epidemiology. I know, why don't we just stick to calling it one thing?!
