      <description>At rOpenSci’s annual unconf, I suggested a project to work on functions that convert physical growth measurements into z-scores and percentiles. For example, researchers in the United States studying childhood obesity often calculate the BMI z-score or percentage of the 95th percentile of BMI from nationally representative survey data.
During the process of brainstorming and working on this project, the team1 I was working with found out some related R packages that do this.</description>

      <description>It’s been a couple of months since rstudio::conf 2018 and I’m still mulling over what I learned in 2 days in San Diego. I grew up in the sunshine of San Diego, so it was good to be back and also feel inspired by the amazing energy of the R community. Here’s a reflection on what the conference was like, what ideas I’ve been running with, and how what I learned will change what I do over the course of the next year.</description>
