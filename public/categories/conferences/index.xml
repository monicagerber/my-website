      <description>I have a confession. The first time I used R, when I was a Freshman at Reed College and taking Math 141, I hated it. At the time, R was something that intimidated me and seemed to add more work to my schedule. Oh, how have things changed! Years later I started using R again
What makes a successful conference experience? Coming away from the rstudio::conf 2018 with a feeling of excitement and motivation to get started on projects and to conribute to the R community is a good sign of success.</description>
