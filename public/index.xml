      <description>About my work My name is Monica Gerber and I am a Biostatistician located in Boston, Massachusetts. I have worked at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) since January 2015, when I joined the Department of Psychiatry to work in a research group focused on population mental health. Currently, I work in General Academic Pediatrics and the Center for Community Health Improvement (CCHI).
At MGH I have the pleasure of working on many research and evaluation projects.</description>
