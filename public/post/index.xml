      <description>It’s been a couple of months since rstudio::conf 2018 and I’m still mulling over what I learned in 2 days in San Diego. I grew up in the sunshine of San Diego, so it was good to be back and also feel inspired by the amazing energy of the R community. Here’s a reflection on what the conference was like, what ideas I’ve been running with, and how what I learned will change what I do over the course of the next year.</description>

      <description>rvest in action First, we need to create a html document from the URL of the page we want using read_html().
library(rvest) cdc_site &amp;lt;- read_html(&amp;quot;http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6545a2.htm?s_cid=mm6545a2_w&amp;quot;) After we have the html document, we need to select part of the document using CSS selectors. I read up on selectorgadget (see rvest, /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library/rvest, selectorgadget, selectorgadget.Rmd, Selectorgadget, selectorgadget.R, selectorgadget.html) to help me figure out which selector to use. However, for this task, I found it easier to just extract the type of element we want, which is the table.</description>

      <description>One analysis in the R community that caught my attention is Hilary Parker’s analysis of the most poisoned baby name in US history. I was surprised that my own name didn’t show up in the analysis. If Hilary had a huge loss in 1993, what happened to Monica in 1999?
For a period when I was a kid the name ‘Monica’ is what made the adults turn down the NPR broadcast.</description>

      <description>About my work My name is Monica Gerber and I am a Biostatistician located in Boston, Massachusetts. I started working at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in January 2015, when I joined the Department of Psychiatry to work in a research group focused on population mental health. Currently, I work in General Academic Pediatrics and the Center for Community Health Improvement (CCHI).
At MGH I have the pleasure of working on many research and evaluation projects.</description>
