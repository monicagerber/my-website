      <description>One analysis in the R community that caught my attention is Hilary Parker’s analysis of the most poisoned baby name in US history. I was surprised that my own name didn’t show up in the analysis. If Hilary had a huge loss in 1993, what happened to Monica in 1999?
For a period when I was a kid the name ‘Monica’ is what made the adults turn down the NPR broadcast.</description>
